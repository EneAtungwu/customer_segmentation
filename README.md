# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## Overview
This repository contains code and documentation for a customer segmentation analysis project. The analysis employs K-means clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques to understand customer behavior.

## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to segment customers based on their characteristics and purchasing behavior. By identifying distinct customer segments, businesses can tailor marketing strategies, improve customer service, and optimize product offerings.

## Contents
1. **Data:** 
    - Raw data used for the analysis.
    - Data preprocessing steps.

2. **Notebooks:**
    - Jupyter notebooks containing code for EDA, PCA, and K-means clustering.
    - Clear annotations and explanations are provided within the notebooks.

3. **Results:**
    - Visualizations and insights derived from the analysis.
    - Summary of customer segments identified.

4. **Documentation:**
    - README file (you're reading it!).
    - Instructions for reproducing the analysis.
    - Dependencies and setup instructions.

## Methodology
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
    - Understanding the structure and patterns in the data.
    - Visualizing key features and distributions.
    - Identifying potential outliers and missing values.

2. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA):**
    - Dimensionality reduction technique to capture the variance in the data.
    - Transforming features into principal components.
    - Assessing the contribution of each component to the overall variance.

3. **K-means Clustering:**
    - Unsupervised learning algorithm for clustering similar data points.
    - Determining optimal number of clusters.
    - Assigning customers to respective segments based on clustering results.

## Usage
1. **Setup:**
    - Clone this repository to your local machine.
    - Ensure the necessary dependencies are installed (Python libraries: numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn).

2. **Data Preparation:**
    - Place your raw data file in the "data" directory.
    - Run data preprocessing scripts or notebooks (if provided) to clean and prepare the data for analysis.

3. **Results Interpretation:**
    - Review the visualizations and insights generated from the analysis.
    - Document key findings and recommendations based on the identified customer segments.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate additional clustering algorithms for comparison.
- Explore advanced feature engineering techniques.
- Implement predictive modeling to forecast customer behavior.
